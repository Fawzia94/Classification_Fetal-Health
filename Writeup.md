# Abstract

The goal of this project is to perform a  model to classify the differences of fetal health based on different test results values. We will classify the data into
three categories using various classification algorithms to achieve lowest prediction error.

# Design

This project dataset was provided by Kaggle, We use this data to bulid a model to predict the Fetal health.

# Data

The dataset features include Baseline value Fetal Heart Rate (FHR), Accelerations, Fetal movement, Uterine contractions, Severe decelerations, Prolonged decelerations,
Abnormal short-term variability, Percentage of time with abnormal long-term variability, Fetal health

Raws:2126 rows
Columns: 22 columns

# Algorithms

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random forest
- SVC

# Tools
 
- Python Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
- sklearn for machine learning

# Communication

After testing our model this figuer shows how we got a perfct Fetal health prediction
